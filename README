acts_as_tree_hacks
------------------

Adds the option to pass a :conditions parameter to the :children and :parent associations.

Example:

acts_as_tree :order => "position ASC, title ASC", :conditions => ['visible_in_menu = ?', true]

This will make the #children and #parent methods only return those records which have "visible_in_menu = true"
